# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Data Analysis with Python

This project delves into a dataset of movies from past years, containing attributes such as title, rating, genre, release year, audience score, budget, gross revenue, and more. Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, I explored trends and correlations within the film industry. The analysis began with data quality checks, identifying and handling missing data, outliers, and duplicates. I then transformed categorical data, ordered the dataset for clarity, and created a correlation matrix to reveal relationships, particularly focusing on factors influencing gross revenue. Using visualizations like scatter plots and analyses of top-grossing companies, I examined industry patterns across genres, release years, and budget levels. This project provides a data-driven perspective on key elements contributing to a movieâ€™s financial success. Check out the code and findings in the repository!
